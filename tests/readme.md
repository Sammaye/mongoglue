# Tests

This folder, just like the helpers folder is by no means required or a core part of the ORM.

These are basically PHPUnit tests that can be run on the ORM to maintain backward compatibility with features and behaviour you have come to expect from it.

You can either tie these into your phing/make/whatever script or delete this folder.
